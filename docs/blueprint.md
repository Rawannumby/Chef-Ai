- Use clean, minimalist icons throughout the app to represent ingredients, dietary preferences, and actions. Icons should be easily understandable and aesthetically consistent.
- Employ a user-friendly layout that prioritizes clarity and ease of navigation. Ensure sufficient spacing between elements and use a consistent grid system to maintain visual harmony. Focus on a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user engagement and provide feedback on interactions. Examples include smooth transitions when generating recipes or gentle highlighting of selected ingredients.
